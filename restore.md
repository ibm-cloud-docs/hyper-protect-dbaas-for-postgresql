{: #restore_postgresql_databases}
{: help} 
{: support}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.ihsdbaas_postgresql_full}} service automatically triggers a backup of your complete database once every 24 hours. These encrypted backups are available for the last seven days and redundantly available on local storage in all availability zones of the supported regions.

To restore a backup to an existing service instance, open a support request:
1. Go to the Support Center to [create a new case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/form){: external}.
2. Select the type of support you need: **Your resources**.
3. In the product name field, enter **{{site.data.keyword.ihsdbaas_postgresql_full}}** or scroll down to select the product.
4. Select the service instance you want to restore. Click **Next**.
5. In the **Subject** field, enter at least **Restore**.
6. In the **Description** box, enter a date within the last seven days as the date of the backup from which the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} team will restore from.
7. Leave the **Email me Updates** checkbox selected so that you can receive support case notifications.
8. Click **Next**. Review your case summary, and click **Submit case**. 

When the restore completes, the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Support team will inform you. Alternatively you can follow the ticket progress on the [Manage cases page](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases){: external}.
